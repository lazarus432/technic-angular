		<p>
      Through my work experiences, I have learned self-discipline, how to effectively manage time,
      a dedication to a higher purpose, as well as the ability to communicate effectively with people
      of all races, creeds, and religions. It has been about two years since I discovered a passion and
      drive for creative, responsive web development.  Over these past couple years I have been focused
      on learning everything I can in order to improve myself as well as my technical skills.
